# ramaworks-updates-log

Ever since RAMAWORKS moved away from update blogs to a continually updated page, they've been able to scrub the history of their updates - removing broken promises and evidence of logistical incompetence. 

This repository seeks to keep RAMAWORKS honest by screenshotting their updates page once a day and saving it here for all to see.

Improvement ideas (PRs are welcome!)
- Save HTML of page alongside PNG
- Extract data from HTML and store as text
- Create diff log, highlighting dates where the contents of the updates page has changed
